## Types of Hypervisors 
1. Type 1: Type 1 are commonly called Bare metal or native if anything runs natively in your computer. 

2. Type 2: Type 2 are the one that we know as regular virtual machines 

### Virtual Manager 
Virtual manager support different types of virtualization such as Qemu, Zen and Xen used in Linux and windows. 

### Installing Endeavour OS in Virtual Manager 
The first step to install Endeavour, installing all packages to run virtual-manger. Second, it is important to enable livirtd service, Third, check for the status to see if it downloading properly. 
Fourth, it is important to re-star the computer. Fifth, after Download has been completed, star the installation as regularly you do in a virtual machine.
